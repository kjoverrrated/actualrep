@ yo, mr b >> this is the actual github repository. idk which one you have, because as of just now, it wasn't this one.


1. relate canvas to pygame
2. start building in canvas (primarily start page, user input via clicking, getting images/characters on the screen)
3. getting it (the main plan/game) working (functionality >> bad code)
4. spring cleaning (removing redundancies, making functions, creating a sense of togetherness, no bugs)
5. extra features if time permits
6. done
